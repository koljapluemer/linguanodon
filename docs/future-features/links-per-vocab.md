# Links per vocab

- first, ensure these are persisted. do they need their own repo?
- add a "note" field to enable tasks like "find a real world source where this term is used", which maybe would be cool to annotate?
    - also, to dish out such tasks, do we need to track how common a vocab unit is? ...I think priority is probably fine.
