# Managing Vocab

- make a page that lists vocab (paginated) and a manage page where a given vocab unit can be edited (or added)
- lots of inspiration for that in the legacy code
- we should move some stuff, maybe, into features (e.g. manging/adding notes)
    - I think we need a database for notes as well? they're currently simply ignored by dexie
