# Managing Translations

- Translations are "hidden" behind vocab, and that's how it should be, as well
- However, from a user perspective, we also want to see our learning items listed by native lang
- So effectively, we probably want a page which lists vocab (manage with `docs/future-features/manage-vocab.md`) which also has a toggle to show native, and then do rather fancy stuff via the repo interface of `vocab`
