# Tasks to add missing translations

- relevant for stuff like [learning goals](docs/future-features/learning-goals.md), you likely often have stuff where you first have to "complete the flash card"
- make sure that works in both directions, target w/o translation, and ghost vocab w/ no target lang
- we probably, long term, want a merging functionality ('this translation already exists') or even make this fully automatic, but we can push that out a little.
