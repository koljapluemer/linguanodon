# Better Queue Flow

*some improvements on queue as it is implemented*

- Actually allow adding adding vocab to the immersion content, directly on the task
- render task prompt and extra info as markdown
- show the widget to add a pronunciation *on the initial screen*, without a useless "please click when you're ready" prompt. 


- allow instant skipping (via the dotask widget)
