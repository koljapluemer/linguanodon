Let's change up how tasks are done.

I already simplified (yes, I ALREADYYYY, PAST TENSE, DIIID THIS) the [task model](src/entities/tasks/Task.ts).

The goal is to get rid of the [task repo](src/entities/tasks/TaskRepo.ts) and [its contract](src/entities/tasks/TaskRepoContract.ts).

Therefore, we can then no longer generate and persist task in features such as [this](src/features/resource-update-tasks), [this](src/features/resources-manage/ResourceListWidget.vue) or [this](src/features/goal-update-tasks).

Instead, [lesson flavors](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator) generate them ad-hoc, when needed.

To aid them, we have [a new directory task-generator](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/task-generator) in which we want to have one file per task type `generate$TaskName` which exposes a function to, well, generate a given task.

We may also add/change [utils](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/utils) that for example check which tasks *can* be generated for a given vocab, or return a random generated task for a resource, etc.

Since we are no longer persisting tasks, we must remove the `task` property from `*Data.ts` interfaces such as [VocabData](src/entities/vocab/vocab/VocabData.ts).

We then need some more properties to decide which tasks can be generated for a given learning entity.

`VocabData` is fine, we use its `progress` object's level and due state as before for the various needs.

[resourcedata](src/entities/resources/ResourceData.ts) has a new `finishedExtracting: boolean;` prop. This decides whether can be used for extraction tasks.

[ImmersionContent](src/entities/immersion-content/ImmersionContentData.ts) has the same. 

Both of these must thus be amended in their creation function throughout the codebase.

Just default them to false.

By the way: You do NOOOOOOOOOOOT need to implement any legacy fallbacks or safe conversion strategy. This is a prototype. Old db is thrown away!!!!!!!!! I do not want legacy garbage in my code for "backwards compatibility"

[GoalData](src/entities/goals/GoalData.ts) also got a bunch of new props which needs to be validly initialized on creation:

```

  finishedAddingSubGoals: boolean;
  finishedAddingMilestones: boolean;
  finishedAddingKnowledge: boolean;
  milestones: Record<string, boolean>;
```

..defaulting to false and empty milestones dict

## Clarification Questions

Based on analysis of the codebase, the following questions need clarification:

### Task Generation Architecture
1. **Task Generator Structure**: The instruction mentions creating `generate$TaskName` functions in `src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/task-generator/`. Should these be individual files (e.g., `generateAddPronunciation.ts`) or a single file with multiple exports? What should the function signature look like?

One file per task type. Sensible function signature. Return a `Task`.

2. **Task Generator vs Existing Generators**: There are existing task generators in `src/features/vocab-update-tasks/generators/` that extend `VocabTaskGeneratorBase`. Should the new task generators follow this same pattern, or should they be simpler standalone functions? How do we handle the transition?

AS FUCKING MENTIONED ABOVE, these are legacy, cannot work in the new paradigm in this form, and have to be moved into `src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/task-generator/` files with the relevant conversions

3. **Task Data Model Mismatch**: The current `TaskData` interface (src/entities/tasks/Task.ts:2-27) includes properties not mentioned in the instruction like `evaluateDifficultyAfterDoing`, `decideWhetherToDoAgainAfterDoing`, `isOneTime`, `isActive`, and `lastShownAt`. Should these be removed or preserved in the new ad-hoc generation approach?

Removed.

### Entity Data Updates
4. **VocabData Tasks Property**: The instruction says to remove the `task` property from `*Data.ts` interfaces, but `VocabData` has a `tasks: string[]` property (line 16). Should this be removed entirely, or does "task" refer to a different property?

Remove.

5. **ResourceData and ImmersionContentData**: Both already have `finishedExtracting: boolean` properties (ResourceData:12, ImmersionContentData:20). The instruction says to add this property and default it to false. Should we ignore this since they already exist, or are there additional changes needed?

yes, I added it to the interface. you still need to properly initialize/use it all throughout the code base

6. **GoalData Initialization**: The new GoalData properties are already present in the interface. Where specifically should the initialization with default values occur? In creation functions, constructors, or repo save methods?

Whenever its relevant.

### Legacy Code Removal
7. **Utils Function Updates**: Functions like `addTasksForVocabList` (src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/utils/addTasksForVocabList.ts:6-24) and `getRandomActiveTaskForVocab` currently depend on TaskRepo. Should these be updated to work with the new ad-hoc generation, or removed entirely?

Updated, AS FUCKING SPECIFIED

8. **Lesson Flavor Integration**: How should lesson flavors (src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/flavors/) integrate with the new task generators? Should they call the generators directly, or go through a centralized task generation service?

call generators directly

### Implementation Details
9. **Task Size and Difficulty**: How should the new generators determine `taskSize` ('big' | 'medium' | 'small') and other task properties that were previously stored? Should these be calculated on-the-fly based on entity properties?

taskSize is obsolete, I removed it

10. **Associated Entities**: The TaskData interface supports multiple associated entity types (vocab, resources, factCards, goals). Should the new generators be able to create tasks that span multiple entity types, or stay focused on single entities?

What do you mean??? I told you to LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK AT current task generation. Obviously you have not done that, thank you. Your fucking task is to generate the SAME FUCKING KIDN OF TASKS, with the SAME FUCKING ATTACHED ENTITIES as we re already doing, simply ad hoc. you can see which entities we are currently attaching by looking in the fucking file to see wich fucking entities we are currently attaching.
