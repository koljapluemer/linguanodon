# Remote Stub Pages

I want to implement a feature where users can download material from a server.
For now, let's build some UI for this.

Make a new page "Downloads" and link in header.
This page should have an internal tabbed layout (check tailwind+daisy).
Every tab should correspond to a widget, which LATER will acess features, maybe.

For now, make only two such tab widgets â€” they themselves should only contain the headings for now:
- "Download Example Packs"
- "Download Resource Challenges"
