- Make a src/shared function that randomly picks from an array, weighted. takes an array of arbitrary type, and an array of numeric weights. Must be same size. Every weight must be above one. Then function should work such that something with weight 3 is no avg picked 3 times more than something with weight 1 but half as much as something with weight 6.
- use this function to adapt [make task](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/makeTask.ts): 2 times out of 3, utilize the pick-task-by-weight function. but rest of the time, make a new util function which picks a task that has not been seen much
- for that, rebuild [this](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/utils/usePronunciationTaskTracker.ts) into a more general function `useTaskTypeTracker` that tracks all task names for this session
- expose its previous functionality, whether it's still allowed to do pronunication tasks, as a function
- have another function recommendRareTask which finds which task names occur least in the current session (including of course tasks that haven't occured at all!) and takes this sorted list through [this](src/shared/pickRandomFromSortedList.ts) (which should be integrated into [array utils](src/shared/arrayUtils.ts) and deleted btw) and returns that task name
- our new task picker option then tries to generate a valid task, if it can't, go through all other tasks until it finds one, similar to how [this](src/pages/queue/lesson-generator/utils/chooseTaskBasedOnDesiredTaskSize.ts) handles fallback
