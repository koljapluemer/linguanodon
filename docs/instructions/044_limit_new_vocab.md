Similar to [here](docs/instructions/043_pronunciation_task_tracker.md), track how many new/unseen vocab tasks are in the last 30. If it's more than 3, prevent new from being added.

Also, use localStorage to track how many new vocab hve been practiced today (valid even if user refreshes). If it's more than 20, prevent tasks that add new vocab.
