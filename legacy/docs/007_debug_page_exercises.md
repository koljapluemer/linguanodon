# Debug Page for Exercise (Generation)

Make a dedicated page where we can edit a unit of meaning (implies basic for for that), and based on that we can see what happens if we generate different exercises.

For now, let's [the page](../src/pages/debug/PageDebugExerciseGen.vue) and allow editing the unit of meaning (it's not persisted or anything): [control](../src/components/forms/control/FormControlUnitOfMeaning.vue) + [render](../src/components/forms/render/FormRenderUnitOfMeaning.vue)
