# Adding Missing Translations


We want to establish a new kind of exercise, with a new lesson defined around it.

The point is that we find words/sentences that are missing translations in any of the users target lang (if the given unit is in a native lang) â€” or units where no translation in *none* of the users native lang exist, if the unit is in a target lang.

Note the difference here:
- We assume that the user is interested in adding translations for all his target langs for a given native unit
- We assume that the user only needs to add a translation for *one/any* of his native langs (if he has several) for a given target lang unit

Then, we make an exercise that asks the user for exactly that: Adding a translation to the unit.
This is a fairly simple form: language select, content (for now).

As for the lesson, use a very simple format: Choose random nr of exercises in the normal range, pick 1-3 missing-translation exercises, fill up the rest.
