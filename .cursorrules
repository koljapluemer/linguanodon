- DO NOT WRITE ESSAYS, DO NOT GIVE HIGH LEVEL TIPS, DO NOT SPAM ENDLESS EXPLANATIONS. SIMPLY IMPLEMENT THE FIX OR FEATURE REQUESTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Use [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview):
- That means, we have the following layers (in order), each with their own folder:
  - app/
  - pages/
  - processes/
  - widgets/
  - features/
  - entities/
  - shared/

- As a general rule, code may ONLY!!!! depend on layers BELOW!!
- In each of these layers, we have *slices* defined by our project at hand, such as `entities/lessons` and `entities/tasks`.
- Slices are made from cohesive, interconnected collection of files
- They may NOT!! depend on slices on the same layer, or on layers above them!!



- Use Tailwind + Daisy UI for styling
  - Ensure that the layout works on mobile and desktop. Keep in mind both light and dark mode, avoid hardcoding white, greys and blacks.
- follow Vue3/ts best practices
- Our interfaces (and their implementation, currently dexie)

- Page components should include MINIMAL implementation logic. That should live in util functions, called from components, not pages.
- Components are either controller (logic, maybe dependency and store, do nothing in template except loading a representational component) or representational only (just props and emits, no external dependencies)
- keep code unit-testable as much a possible
- fix linter errors always
- do not replicate type files! types should always live in dedicated files (unless ONLY relevant hyper-locally), and existing types should be reused.
- use lucide icons (lucide-vue-next). Ensure!! icon names are valid ([icon list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mazeincoding/lucide-icons-list/refs/heads/main/icons.txt))

- do NOT run `npm run dev`. It's annoying and useless.

## How to Add a Feature

### High-Level Organisation

As a rule:

- Open an issue (work towards an issue)
- make a branch

### Development

- Add unit tests via the configured `vitest` environment
  - It's not required to use TDD, but it may make sense, especially when working on logic-heave features
  - However, each added feature should at least be convered in regards to basic happy path

- Keep files reasonably small.
- Write VERY CLEAN code. functions and lines of code should be self-explanatory. If a collection of code lines is confusing to read (or even just a single line), it should likely be its own function
- Keep components and pages as purely representational as possible

- Types and interfaces live in `/types` unless they are 100% only usable in one file or page. Do NOT, EVER, copypaste types in component files

- ALWAYS use `@/...` import syntax, except if the the imported thing is in the same directory. That's way more robust, and way more readable.

### Documentation

- Write conceptual stuff in `docs/` as a markdown guide
- Code should mostly document itself, see chapter above
- Use JsDoc style annotation, but ONLY!! to explain purpose or non-obvious decisions. Do NOT! JS-Doc annotate params or returns, that is *already done* by typescript. Keep it short. Explain how the code fits into the bigger picture.
- Avoid! just reiterating the name of a function (or whatever), e.g. we do not want to see `downloadLatestLessons() // downloads the latest lessons`. That is wasteful. Focus on purpose and how it ties in!

### Testing

- Write unit tests, component test and integration test when it's useful to improve our confidence
- Test files should live alongside the code they are testing

### Tech Stack

- Standard Vue + Vite app
    - Meaning, per-default, we are doing things *server-side*
- `eslint` is setup. Don't forget to run linter.
- we have `Tailwind` + `Daisy UI` installed, utilize that for design
    - Avoid manual CSS when possible
