- Use Tailwind + Daisy UI for styling
- follow Vue3/ts best practices
- Our dexie database is the single source of truth
- Components should be representational ONLY
- keep code unit-testable as much a possible
- fix linter errors always
- do not replicate type files! types should always live in dedicated files (unless ONLY relevant hyper-locally), and existing types should be reused.
- use lucide icons. Ensure!! icon names are valid ([icon list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mazeincoding/lucide-icons-list/refs/heads/main/icons.txt))


## How to Add a Feature

### High-Level Organisation

As a rule:

- Open an issue (work towards an issue)
- make a branch

### Development

- Add unit tests via the configured `vitest` environment
  - It's not required to use TDD, but it may make sense, especially when working on logic-heave features
  - However, each added feature should at least be convered in regards to basic happy path

- Keep files reasonably small.
- Write VERY CLEAN code. functions and lines of code should be self-explanatory. If a collection of code lines is confusing to read (or even just a single line), it should likely be its own function
- Keep components and pages as purely representational as possible

- Types and interfaces live in `/types` unless they are 100% only usable in one file or page. Do NOT, EVER, copypaste types in component files

- ALWAYS use `@/...` import syntax, except if the the imported thing is in the same directory. That's way more robust, and way more readable.

### Documentation

- Write conceptual stuff in `docs/` as a markdown guide
- Code should mostly document itself, see chapter above
- Use JsDoc style annotation, but ONLY!! to explain purpose or non-obvious decisions. Do NOT! JS-Doc annotate params or returns, that is *already done* by typescript. Keep it short.

### Tech Stack

- Standard Vue + Vite app
    - Meaning, per-default, we are doing things *server-side*
- `eslint` is setup. Don't forget to run linter.
- we have `Tailwind` + `Daisy UI` installed, utilize that for design
    - Avoid manual CSS when possible

### Data

- source of truth is a local, per-user `dexie.js` database
