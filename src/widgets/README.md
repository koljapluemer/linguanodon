# widgets/

The Widgets layer is intended for large self-sufficient blocks of UI. Widgets are most useful when they are reused across multiple pages, or when the page that they belong to has multiple large independent blocks, and this is one of them.

If a block of UI makes up most of the interesting content on a page, and is never reused, it should not be a widget, and instead it should be placed directly inside that page.
