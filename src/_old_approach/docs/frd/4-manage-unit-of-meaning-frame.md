# Feature Requirements Document: ManageUnitOfMeaning.vue Graphical Frame

## Purpose
Create a presentational shell for the manage unit of meaning screen. This component will serve as the entry point for managing a UnitOfMeaning, providing a visual frame and placeholder for the form. It should be viewable and testable with mock or no data.

## Scope
- Renders a card or panel using DaisyUI + Tailwind.
- Accepts a `uid` prop (string) or route param, but does not fetch or require real data yet.
- Shows three states:
  - Loading (e.g., spinner or skeleton)
  - Error (e.g., error message)
  - Empty (e.g., "No data" message)
- Contains a slot or placeholder for the form (e.g., `<UnitOfMeaningForm />` or a stub).
- No real data fetching or business logic at this stage.

## Requirements
- Use DaisyUI card or panel for layout.
- Use Tailwind for spacing and alignment.
- All text and UI must be accessible and responsive.
- KISS: Keep the component simple and idiomatic.
- Mock the three states with local state or props.
- If a `uid` is provided, display it somewhere in the frame for testing.

## Unit/Component Testing
- Renders with and without `uid` prop.
- Correctly displays loading, error, and empty states.
- Contains a placeholder for the form.
- Snapshot/component test for visual structure.
